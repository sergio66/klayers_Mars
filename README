klayersV205_Mars is a modification of Scott Hannon's klayersV205, to
work for a Martian atmosphere.

All the ideas are the same, with the expected differences, such as
planet radius and gravity.

Key changes include
a) the standard profile (found in Data/glmars.dat)
b) the pressure levels grid (found in Grid/cbplev_mars.f)
c) the GasIDs : initial commit has 6 gases
 (1) WV (2) CO2 (3) N2 (4) O3 (5) CO (6) NO
d) so that means there are no xsec gases

The driver for all of these three is is 
  Matlab/make_airs_std_p_T.m
